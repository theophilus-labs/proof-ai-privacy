    <h1>Privacy Policy – Proof AI</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <h2>Information We Process</h2>
    <p>Proof AI allows users to upload images or paste text for analysis. This content is processed solely for verification purposes, such as identifying possible manipulation, AI generation signals, or matching text to known sources.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uploaded images and text are processed temporarily</li>
        <li>No user accounts are required</li>
        <li>No personal identifiers are requested</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Proof AI does not permanently store uploaded images or text unless explicitly stated within the app. Content is processed in-memory or temporarily for analysis and then discarded.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Proof AI may use trusted third-party services (such as cloud-based AI or OCR providers) strictly to perform analysis. These services process data only as required to deliver results and are not permitted to use the data for advertising or profiling.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>Proof AI does not display ads and does not sell user data.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Proof AI is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data during processing. However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This policy may be updated to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. Updates will be reflected on this page.</p>
